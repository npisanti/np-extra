np-extra
==============
Extra classes for openFrameworks. Includes:   
    
- Phasor class for cyclic animations.
- Classes for managing colors.
- Serialize and deserialize std::vector of glm::vec3, ofVec3f or ofPolyline.

No other addons required for those classes, just oF. Those classes should work on all the oF platforms.
