np-extra
==============
Extra classes for openFrameworks. Includes:

- `np::Phasor` class for cyclic animations.
- `np::PaletteTable` class for smooth transitions between palettes.
- Serialize and deserialize std::vector of glm::vec3, ofVec3f or ofPolyline.
- `np::Playlist` class to load randomly videos on the fly.
- `np::AlphaMasker` class to mask a source texture using a mask texture, can also be used with static methods as `np::masker::draw(...)`
- Classes for managing Scenes and transitions between them.

No other addons required for those classes, just oF. Those classes should work on all the oF platforms.
